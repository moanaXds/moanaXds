## 🚀 About Me

Iam a curious and committed learner passionate about building simulations and solving problems through code. I enjoy creating interactive 2D games using C++ and OpenGL, and Iam especially skilled in dry running (tracing code step-by-step) to understand and debug it effectively. My projects combine "Object-Oriented Programming", queue-based game logic, and real-time visual elements with "SFFML" and "GLUT".
