## 🚀 About Me

Iam a curious and committed learner passionate about building simulations and solving problems through code. I enjoy creating interactive 2D games using C++ and OpenGL, and Iam especially skilled in dry running (tracing code step-by-step) to understand and debug it effectively. My projects combine "Object-Oriented Programming", queue-based game logic, and real-time visual elements with "SFFML" and "GLUT".

## 🎮 Projects

### 🔹 [C++ Simulation Game – OpenGL + SFFML]
An interactive 2D city simulation where the player acts in *dual modes* (taxi and delivery), solving real-time tasks while navigating through buildings, fuel stations, and road obstacles.  
🧠 Features:
- Queue-based task system  
- Role switching logic  
- Obstacle and collision management  
- Object-Oriented class hierarchy  
- Real-time game controls with OpenGL & SFFML
